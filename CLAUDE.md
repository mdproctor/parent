# parent Workspace
**Name:** casehub

**Physical path:** `/Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/parent/CLAUDE.md`
**Symlinked at:** `/Users/mdproctor/claude/public/casehub/CLAUDE.md`
**Project repo:** `/Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/parent`
**Workspace:** `/Users/mdproctor/claude/public/casehub`
**Workspace type:** public

## Session Start

Run `add-dir /Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/parent` before any other work.

## Artifact Locations

| Skill | Writes to |
|-------|-----------|
| brainstorming (specs) | `specs/` |
| writing-plans (plans) | `plans/` |
| handover | `HANDOFF.md` |
| idea-log | `IDEAS.md` |
| design-snapshot | `snapshots/` |
| java-update-design / update-primary-doc | `design/JOURNAL.md` (created by `epic`) |
| adr | `adr/` |
| write-blog | `blog/` |

## Structure

- `HANDOFF.md` — session handover (single file, overwritten each session)
- `IDEAS.md` — idea log (single file)
- `specs/` — brainstorming / design specs (superpowers output)
- `plans/` — implementation plans (superpowers output)
- `snapshots/` — design snapshots with INDEX.md (auto-pruned, max 10)
- `adr/` — architecture decision records with INDEX.md
- `blog/` — project diary entries with INDEX.md
- `design/` — epic journal (created by `epic` at branch start)

## Git Discipline

Two git repositories are active in every session:
- **Workspace** (`/Users/mdproctor/claude/public/casehub`) — methodology artifacts: handover, blog (staging before publish), plans, snapshots
- **Project repo** (`/Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/parent`) — source code, ADRs (`docs/adr/`), specs

Never rely on CWD for git operations — the session may have started in either repo. Always use explicit paths:
```bash
git -C /Users/mdproctor/claude/public/casehub ...       # workspace artifacts
git -C /Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/parent ...       # project artifacts
```
The file path determines the repo: if the file lives under `Workspace`, use the workspace path; if under `Project repo`, use the project path.


## Rules

- All methodology artifacts go here, not in the project repo
- Promotion to project repo is always explicit — never automatic
- Workspace branches mirror project branches — switch both together

## Routing

| Artifact   | Destination | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| adr        | project     | lands in `docs/adr/` |
| blog       | project     | lands in `docs/blog/` — promoted at work end |
| design     | project     | journal file lives in workspace design/; DESIGN.md merge target is project docs/DESIGN.md |
| snapshots  | workspace   | |
| specs      | project     | lands in docs/specs/ |
| plans      | workspace   | |
| handover   | workspace   | |

# CaseHub Parent

## Project Type

type: java

## Repository Role

Root parent POM for the CaseHub ecosystem. Owns shared build configuration, CI/CD workflows, cross-module conventions, and the full-stack build orchestration.

**Peer repos (each has its own Claude session — do not commit to these):**
platform, eidos, ledger, connectors, iot, work, worker, qhorus, pages, engine, claudony, openclaw, neocortex, devtown, aml, clinical, drafthouse, life, quarkmind, flow, blocks, soc, fsitrading, desiredstate, ras, ops, workers

## Build Commands

```bash
# Install parent POM only
mvn --batch-mode install

# Publish to GitHub Packages (CI only — requires GITHUB_TOKEN)
mvn --batch-mode deploy -DskipTests
```

## CI/CD Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `publish.yml` | push/main, dispatch, manual | Publish parent POM; dispatch to ledger + connectors |
| `build-all.yml` | manual only | Deleted — use build-all.yml with force_rebuild=true |
| `incremental-build-all.yml` | manual only | SHA-keyed incremental build — BUILD/TEST/SKIP per module based on what changed |
| `clear-snapshot-packages.yml` | manual only | Delete SNAPSHOT artifacts from GitHub Packages |
| `generate-api-catalogue.yml` | push (docs/repos/*/api/**), weekly, manual | Regenerate cross-repo SPI overlay from aggregated API docs |
| `sync-guides.yml` | repository_dispatch, manual | Sync `docs/guides/` from child repos via subtree |

**Key rule:** Cross-repo `repository_dispatch` requires `GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}` (classic PAT). `GITHUB_TOKEN` is repo-scoped only and returns 403 on cross-repo calls.

## Cross-Repo Conventions

Conventions shared across all modules live in the **casehub garden** (`../garden/docs/protocols/`). Each file is self-contained. See `../garden/docs/protocols/INDEX.md` for the full list. Do not write protocol files in this repo — they belong in `casehub/garden` so they always land on main regardless of what branch parent is on.

**Critical:** Never commit or push to peer repo directories (`../ledger`, `../work`, etc.). Each repo has its own Claude session. For cross-repo fixes, create a GitHub issue on the target repo instead.

## Scripts

`scripts/build-all-decision.sh` — pure bash decision function for the incremental build. Given a module's current SHA, previous SHA, and dep SHAs, outputs `BUILD`, `TEST`, or `SKIP`. No side effects.

`scripts/tests/build-all-decision.bats` — bats test suite (49 tests) covering all BUILD/TEST/SKIP scenarios. Run with: `bats scripts/tests/build-all-decision.bats`

Prereq: `brew install bats-core`

`scripts/generate-api-docs.sh` — generates markdown API docs from a repo's `-api` module using jmarkdoc. Downloads jmarkdoc.jar on first run (cached in `.build/`). Requires JDK 25+ (auto-detects). Usage: `generate-api-docs.sh <repo-root> [<api-source-dir>]`. Default source: `api/src/main/java`.

`scripts/api-catalogue/generate_overlay.py` — reads aggregated API docs from `docs/repos/*/api/`, greps source for cross-repo SPI implementations, generates `docs/api/cross-repo-implementations.md`. Tests: `scripts/tests/test_generate_overlay.py`

`scripts/doc_freshness_core.py` — structural anchor parser and staleness detection. Parses YAML frontmatter anchors from documentation, matches git diff against anchors. Vendored from soredium/doc-freshness. Tests: `scripts/tests/test_doc_freshness_ci.py`

`scripts/doc-freshness-check-ci.py` — CI wrapper for doc freshness detection. Called by the `doc-freshness.yml` reusable workflow.

`scripts/check-anchor-integrity.py` — verifies structural anchors (class/SPI names) resolve in the codebase. Called by CI on every PR.

`scripts/generate-dependency-graph.py` — POM analysis across all child repos, generates `dependency-graph.json`. Called by daily `dependency-graph.yml` Action.

## Testing

Surefire is configured in this parent POM with `rerunFailingTestsCount=2` — failing tests are retried twice before being marked as failures, surfacing flaky vs consistently broken.

**Config architecture:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdproctor/parent/main/docs/config-architecture.md

## Writing Style Guide

**The writing style guide at `~/claude-workspace/writing-styles/blog-technical.md` is mandatory for all blog and diary entries.** Load it in full before drafting. Complete the pre-draft voice classification (I / we / Claude-named) before generating any prose. Do not show a draft without verifying it against the style guide.

## Project Artifacts

Paths that are project content (not workspace noise). Skills use this to avoid
filtering or dropping commits that touch these paths.

| Path | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project conventions |
| `docs/` | Platform documentation (INDEX.md, guides/, platform/, repos/, APPLICATIONS.md, arc42stories spec + README) |
| `docs/adr/` | Architecture decision records |


## IntelliJ MCP Routing

One IntelliJ MCP server is available:

- **`mcp__intellij-index__*`** — use this for ALL code intelligence and navigation. Supports auto-opening projects via `project_path` — pass the project path and the plugin opens it automatically. Never ask the user to open a project manually.

`mcp__intellij__*` (built-in JetBrains MCP) is **disabled** due to a memory leak. Do not attempt to use it. All operations (find class, find references, type hierarchy, diagnostics, rename, move) go through `mcp__intellij-index__*`.

**If a project is not open:** pass `project_path` to any `mcp__intellij-index__` tool — it opens automatically. Do not fall back to bash. Do not launch IntelliJ from the command line.

## Development Workflow

Before designing: `superpowers:brainstorming`
Before implementing: `superpowers:test-driven-development`
For all Java work: `java-dev` (loads `testing-principles` + `ide-tooling`)
Before committing: `superpowers:requesting-code-review`
After implementation: `implementation-doc-sync` (scoped doc sweep)

**Prompt snippet:** `docs/prompt-snippets.md` — paste the work-item snippet at the start of each issue to enforce the above chain explicitly.

Living docs — check for drift after significant changes:
- `docs/INDEX.md` — discovery index (add new capabilities here)
- `docs/guides/building-apps.md` — app builder guide (update when platform changes affect apps)
- `docs/guides/building-platform.md` — platform builder guide
- `docs/platform/` — topic chunks (update the relevant chunk when a capability changes)
- `docs/APPLICATIONS.md`
- `docs/repos/` — deep-dives (update when a repo's modules/SPIs change)
