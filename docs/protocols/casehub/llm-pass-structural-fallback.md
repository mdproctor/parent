When a Foundation extension adds an optional LLM enrichment pass to a rendering SPI (e.g. `SystemPromptRenderer`, `CapabilityNarrativeGenerator`), the structural fallback path must produce correct, format-specific output for every declared output format — not just the primary format. The LLM pass is an enhancement; the extension must function correctly without any LLM configured, and the structural output must honour the caller's requested format. Extensions that produce CLAUDE_MD-structured output regardless of format when no LLM is present are violating this rule.
