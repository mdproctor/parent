When a renderer caches output that is format-specific (CLAUDE_MD, OPENAI_SYSTEM, A2A_CARD, etc.), the cache key must include the `RenderFormat` dimension. A key that encodes only the semantic input (descriptor hash, context hash, template version) is insufficient: the same semantic input produces structurally different output for each format. Callers requesting OPENAI_SYSTEM must not receive cached CLAUDE_MD content. The canonical cache key is: `descriptorHash + ":" + contextHash + ":" + format.name() + ":" + templateVersion`.
