## What It Is

A clinical trial coordination application built on the CaseHub agentic harness. Coordinates eligibility screening agents, safety monitoring agents, PI authorisation gates, and IRB approval gates across multiple trial sites — producing an FDA-compliant, GDPR-aware, independently verifiable audit trail. Field showcase and tutorial for Java developers in regulated healthcare (pharma, biotech, clinical research).

GCP domain knowledge is a prerequisite for this audience — and it is standard knowledge for Java developers in that field. The same developer who evaluates CaseHub for their trial coordination system is the developer who follows the tutorial to build it.

Scored 24/25 on market fit — highest of all evaluated use cases. Demonstrates that GCP, FDA, and EMA requirements cannot be met by workflow-based LLM coordination and are structurally satisfied by CaseHub's foundation.

Comparison baseline: ClinicalAgent (arXiv 2404.14777, ACM BCB '24, open source). See `docs/use-case-analysis.md` §8.1 and `docs/tutorial-strategy.md` §7 in this repo.

## Tutorial Layers

The tutorial structure emerges from the natural adoption sequence. Each layer adds one foundation module and makes its value tangible relative to the previous layer. The code at every layer is production-grade. See `docs/tutorial-strategy.md §7` for teaching objectives per layer.

## What It Owns

- Clinical trial domain model: `ClinicalTrial`, `TrialSite`, `PatientEnrollment`, `ProtocolDeviation`, `AdverseEvent`, `IrbApproval`
- Capability tags: `eligibility-screening`, `safety-monitoring`, `protocol-review`, `irb-consultation`, `pi-authorisation`, `data-safety-monitoring`, `regulatory-submission`, `trial-supervisor`
- Trust dimensions: `safety-accuracy`, `eligibility-precision`, `protocol-adherence`
- Multi-site trial `CasePlanModel` — site-level sub-cases with trial-level aggregation
- Adverse event escalation — 24h/7d GCP SLA WorkItems with CTCAE grading
- PI authorisation — formal COMMAND creates Commitment; deviation requires named PI approval; MAJOR deviations trigger GCP §4.5 sponsor notification via `SponsorNotifier` SPI (`api/spi/`) — durable delivery via `DurableSponsorNotifier` (clinical#21)
- `SafetyOfficerNotifier` SPI (`api/spi/`) — observes `AdverseEventReportedEvent` (Grade 3+ only); dispatches via casehub-connectors-core; writes `SafetyOfficerNotificationLedgerEntry` for GCP/FDA audit — clinical#11 ✅

  **`DurableSponsorNotifier`** (replaces `DefaultSponsorNotifier`): `notify()` persists a `SponsorNotification` entity in PENDING state and returns immediately; async delivery via `SponsorNotificationRetryJob` (@Scheduled, poll-based). `SponsorNotificationRetryPolicy` (SingleValuePreference, casehub-platform-config) controls `maxAttempts`, `retryInterval`, optional `backoffMultiplier` (≥1.0, default 1.0 = fixed interval), and optional `maxInterval` (cap on computed delay). Config format: `"3,30"` or `"3,15,2.0"` or `"3,15,2.0,120"`. `SponsorNotificationLedgerEntry` (qhorus datasource, V2020) records per-attempt outcomes; `subjectId = notificationId` for GDPR-independent erasure. `SponsorNotificationDeliveryService` three-phase pattern (load → connector → record). New deps: `casehub-platform-api` in `api/pom.xml`, `casehub-platform-config` + `casehub-ledger-memory` (test) in `runtime/pom.xml`.

  **`SponsorNotificationExhaustedWorkItemListener`**: observes `SponsorNotificationExhaustedEvent` (fired when all delivery retries are consumed) and creates a casehub-work WorkItem for `site-coordinators` with a 24h SLA for CRITICAL deviations, 72h otherwise. WorkItem creation failure is absorbed (log and continue).

  **Notification SPI pattern** (`SponsorNotifier` + `SafetyOfficerNotifier`): SPI interface in `api/spi/`, implementation in `runtime/service/`, connector delivery via `casehub-connectors-core`. Channel name format: `clinical/deviation/dev-<UUID>/pi-oversight` (qhorus slug validator compliance). `SponsorNotificationRetryJob` excluded via `quarkus.arc.exclude-types` in test config.
- IRB/ethics committee gate — `ClinicalDeviationCaseHub` + `deviation-review.yaml`: CRITICAL protocol deviation + PI approval → 72h WorkItem → four terminal outcomes (APPROVED/REJECTED/DEFERRED/EXPIRED); `IrbDecisionListener` bridges WorkItem lifecycle to `IrbApproval` entity + ledger
- AE escalation policy SPI — `AdverseEventEscalationPolicy` + `DefaultAdverseEventEscalationPolicy` (CTCAE-based): Grade 3 → senior monitor gate; Grade 4+ → senior monitor + DSMB in parallel; `ClinicalAdverseEventCaseHub` + `ae-escalation.yaml` drives adaptive routing via `contextChange.filter`
- `ClinicalTrialCaseHub` + `trial-coordination.yaml` — trial-level DSMB rollup binding (cross-site Grade 4+ pattern detection); owns trial-level `CasePlanModel` not just IRB gate and AE escalation
- `TrialActivationService` — `POST /trials/{id}/activate`; three-phase activation (commit status → startCase().join() → commit caseId); avoids Agroal pool deadlock
- `TrialCaseLookup` — site → trial → engineCaseId lookup for signal routing
- `TrialSafetySignalService` — owns all grade4 blackboard flag operations: `signalGrade4Active(siteId)` sets `grade4Active.<siteId>` on case start (called by `AeEscalationCaseService` after Phase 3); `onAeEscalationCompleted` observes `AeEscalationCompletedEvent` and clears the flag. All trial blackboard signaling routes through this service — `AeEscalationCaseService` no longer injects `CaseHubRuntime` or `TrialCaseLookup` directly.
- `ClinicalTrial.engineCaseId` — UUID field (V110 migration) set on ACTIVE transition
- `AdverseEvent.unexpected` — `boolean` (V111); marks the AE as unexpected per ICH E2A criteria; propagates into AE escalation engine case context
- `AdverseEvent.suspected` — `boolean` (V111); marks suspected causal relationship; propagates into AE escalation engine case context
- `AdverseEvent.escalationStatus` — `AeEscalationStatus` (V111, NOT NULL DEFAULT 'NONE'); tracks AE escalation case lifecycle (NONE / REQUESTED / COMPLETED / FAILED)
- `AdverseEvent.engineCaseId` — UUID nullable (V112); set when AE escalation case starts
- `ProtocolDeviation.engineCaseId` — UUID nullable (V113); set when IRB deviation case starts
- `AeStatusUpdater` — CDI bean that extracts the COMPLETED write-back from `AeEscalationListener`; isolated in `@Transactional(REQUIRES_NEW)` for Panache mockability in tests
- `IrbCommitteeAssignmentPolicy` SPI — maps `IrbCommitteeContext(deviationId, siteId, trialId, severity)` to `IrbCommitteeAssignment(committeeId, candidateGroups)`; interface in `api/spi/`, `@DefaultBean` in `runtime/service/`; mirrors `DeviationResponsePolicy` pattern. Full SPI control of WorkItem routing for `candidateGroups` blocked by engine#387 (dynamic `candidateGroups` from case context in YAML `humanTask` binding)
- `SEVERE_GRADES = Set.of(GRADE_4, GRADE_5)` — shared grade threshold constant in signal services
- **Multi-tenancy foundation (V116, clinical#69):** `tenant_id NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default'` added to all 6 domain entities (`ClinicalTrial`, `TrialSite`, `PatientEnrollment`, `ProtocolDeviation`, `AdverseEvent`, `IrbApproval`). 4 REST resources + `AdverseEventService` inject `CurrentPrincipal` and stamp `tenantId` at persist time. 3 CDI events (`AdverseEventReportedEvent`, `IrbApprovalResolvedEvent`, `ProtocolDeviationResolvedEvent`) + `SponsorNotificationRequest` carry `String tenantId`. Query isolation deferred to casehubio/clinical#71.
- **`ClinicalMemoryService` (clinical#33):** central facade for `CaseMemoryStore` writes and reads. PATIENT domain: `storeAeReport` + `storeAeOutcome`. SITE domain: `storeDeviationReport` + `storePiDecision` (`EXPIRED` maps to `"TIMELINE_BREACH"` outcome). `querySiteContext` uses 180-day window + limit 50. Non-request-context writes (async CDI observers + Quartz threads) degrade to WARN until platform#79 ships. `AeEscalationCaseService.prepareAndMarkRequested()` injects `patientContext` + `siteContext` maps into engine `initialContext`; JQ-navigable (`.patientContext.hasPriorGrade3OrAbove`).
- **Deferred memory domains:** DRUG domain (clinical#72) and IRB domain (clinical#73) — design questions on entityId convention and cross-tenant pharmacovigilance tradeoff to be resolved before implementing.
- **Test workaround (clinical#74):** `ClinicalTestLedgerRepository` (in `test/support/`) replaces `InMemoryLedgerEntryRepository` in `selected-alternatives` because `casehub-ledger-memory` 0.2-SNAPSHOT was not updated simultaneously with `LedgerEntryRepository`'s 2-arg API change. Remove when `casehub-ledger-memory` catches up.
- **Layer 8 — SUSAR Oversight (clinical#77):** dedicated `ClinicalSusarOversightCaseHub` + `susar-oversight.yaml` (capability binding via `spec.capabilities` + programmatic `.function()` registration). Three-phase `SusarOversightCaseService` with idempotency guard. `SusarOversightStatus` enum (NONE/REQUESTED/COMPLETED/FAILED) mirrors `AeEscalationStatus`. `SusarGateDecisionListener` with DB-discriminated `@ConsumeEvent(blocking = true)` for all three gate outcomes (approved/rejected/expired). Writes `SusarDecisionLedgerEntry` (JOINED inheritance, qhorus datasource, V2021). Gate discrimination uses `AdverseEvent.findBySusarOversightCaseId` — avoids `CaseInstanceCache` race condition.
- **Layer 8 — GDPR compliance (clinical#7):** `ConsentWithdrawalService` — GDPR Art.17: pseudonymizes `patientId`, calls `LedgerErasureService.erase()`, erases patient memories. Writes `ConsentWithdrawalLedgerEntry` (V2022). XA required. W3C PROV-DM export (`GET /audit/prov`) and Merkle inclusion proof (`GET /audit/entries/{id}/proof`) endpoints on `PatientResource`.
- **Layer 8 — EU AI Act Art.12 (clinical#76):** `ClinicalComplianceSupplement` factory attaches a `ComplianceSupplement` to all six AI-agent decision ledger entry writers via `entry.attach(supplement)`.
- 3-site showcase scenario vs ClinicalAgent

## The Compliance Gap It Closes

ClinicalAgent (peer-reviewed baseline) structurally cannot provide:
- Adverse event SLA enforcement (GCP: serious events within 24h) — WorkItem `claimDeadline`
- Protocol deviation authorisation by named PI — COMMAND commitment lifecycle
- Consent withdrawal (GDPR Art.17) — ledger erasure and decision context sanitisation
- Multi-site independence with trial-level rollup — sub-case orchestration
- FDA tamper-evident audit trail — Merkle MMR + Ed25519-signed checkpoints
- Trust-weighted safety agent routing — Bayesian Beta from outcome attestations
- Adaptive protocol paths — IRB gate and grade-based AE escalation via casehub-engine `CasePlanModel`

## Layer 5 Integration Notes (casehub-engine)

These apply to any consumer adding casehub-engine to a CaseHub application. Documented from clinical Layer 5 (clinical#6).

**CDI wiring:** casehub-platform and casehub-platform-expression must be on the runtime classpath when casehub-engine is present. Without `casehub-platform`, the engine's `@DefaultBean` mock beans are absent and CDI resolution fails at augmentation time (symptom: `UnsatisfiedResolutionException` for `PreferenceProvider`). Use `<scope>runtime</scope>` — not `test` — in application modules that run the Quarkus build goal. See `casehub/garden: docs/protocols/casehub/casehub-platform-dependency-scope.md`.

**Quartz incompatibility:** `casehub-engine-scheduler-quartz` and the casehub-work scheduler beans conflict if both are on the classpath in the same deployment unit without isolation. Use separate modules or `@IfBuildProperty` gating to avoid double-scheduler registration.

**YAML binding gotchas:**
- `inputMapping` is the correct field name — not `inputSchema`
- `on.contextChange.filter` is the correct path — not `when`

These are silent failures: the YAML parses without error but the binding has no effect at runtime.

**`WorkloadProvider` stub:** `StubWorkloadProvider` is a `@DefaultBean @ApplicationScoped` zero-returning stub required because engine#378 deleted `CasehubWorkloadProvider`. Add it to any `@QuarkusTest` context that activates casehub-engine but does not provide a real workload provider. Root cause tracked in casehubio/engine#393.
