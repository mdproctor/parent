# casehub-fsitrading -- Consumer Guide

> Financial Services Trading application -- multi-agent trading automation, trust-weighted strategy selection, and tamper-evident audit trail for algorithmic trading.

**GitHub:** [casehubio/fsitrading](https://github.com/casehubio/fsitrading)
**Tier:** Application (domain logic on CaseHub foundation)

---

## Purpose

Algorithmic trading application built on the CaseHub platform. Strategies generate trade decisions from market events. Orders execute via a simulated exchange. Positions track quantity and P&L. Every decision is recorded in a tamper-evident ledger, and P&L outcomes feed back as trust attestations so strategy selection improves over time.

Not a framework -- this is a domain application. Trading-specific logic lives here; coordination, audit, and trust primitives come from the platform.

## Module Structure

| Module | Artifact | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `api` | `casehub-fsitrading-api` | Pure-Java (no Quarkus) | Domain model records/enums, SPI interfaces, capability tags, actor identity |
| `app` | `casehub-fsitrading-app` | Quarkus application | REST resources, JPA entities, services, ledger entries, case definitions, Flyway migrations |

## Current State

Chapters 1--2 implemented (August 2026). Working vertical slices: domain model, order lifecycle, position tracking, ledger integration, trust scoring, multi-agent arena, and 5-level market data pipeline with WebSocket push.

**Implemented (C1 Strategy Arena):**
- Strategy Arena -- multi-agent evaluation pipeline: Sequence[Routing → Evaluation → Voting → Risk → Gate → Execute]
- 7 strategy agents registered via eidos `AgentDescriptorRegistrar`
- Multi-select routing, per-instrument majority voting, risk classification with human approval gate
- Order lifecycle, position management, tamper-evident ledger audit trail
- Trust scoring -- Bayesian Beta from P&L attestations with quality floor filtering

**Implemented (C2 Market Pulse):**
- 5-level temporal summarisation pipeline: PriceTick → OHLCV → TrendSummary → RegimeAssessment → SessionNarrative
- Synthetic market data with U-shaped volume profiles and 5 injectable scenarios (flash crash, liquidity drop, gap open, volume spike, mean reversion)
- Computational summarisers (L0-L2) and LLM-powered summarisers (L3-L4) with structured output and graceful degradation
- Observation cache with strategy-level visibility policy for arena agent context
- Market event detection (trend reversal, regime change) via CDI domain events
- Channel bridge to qhorus for L2+ events
- Arena integration -- observation context injected into strategy agent evaluations
- WebSocket push via pages-push EventBroadcaster -- live ticks, bars, trends, regime to browser
- Minimal fsi-market-panel web component (Quinoa + esbuild) proving end-to-end push path
- Sequence + Loop orchestration model via casehub-blocks patterns
- 31 REST endpoints (see API section below)
- Dual-datasource configuration (H2 dev, PostgreSQL prod)

**Implemented (C4a Overnight Ops Backend):**
- Incident lifecycle -- severity classification (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM), off-hours amplification, 2-tier SLA escalation
- YAML case definitions (overnight-incident, fsi-oversight) with CBR config, milestones, goals, capability bindings
- 13 response agents -- 7 rule-based (halt, close, alert, adjust, monitor, verify, halt-and-wait), 6 LLM stubs (reduce, hedge, re-evaluate, close-exposure, sentiment, liquidate)
- Action risk classifier gates high-risk actions (>25% portfolio close, full liquidation, counterparty close) via dedicated oversight CaseHub
- SLA breach policy with claim/completion tiers, escalation to oncall-escalation group
- JPA incident store with timeline tracking (Flyway V105-V106)
- C2 pipeline bridge -- FsiMarketEventDetector fires CDI events for TrendReversalDetected/RegimeChanged
- EventTypeRegistry registration (4 incident event types) + EventBroadcaster push
- 7 incident REST endpoints + WorkItem query/resolve

**Implemented (C3 Trade Deliberation):**
- Multi-agent strategy debate over qhorus channels with epistemic convergence detection
- Commitment lifecycle, context tracking, sub-task dispatch
- See C3 section below for full details

**Implemented (C5a Trading Desk Infrastructure):**
- Dock-workbench page with 10 C1-C3 panels via pages DSL (dataTable, metricGrid, heatmapChart, eventTimeline, hostPanel)
- Composite data binding (REST initial + WebSocket live) via topicSource
- Layout persistence via SQLite-backed REST store
- Quinoa build chain (esbuild, TypeScript)

**Implemented (C4b Overnight Ops Panels):**
- Typed push payloads: IncidentPushPayload (3 records), WorkItemPushPayload (5 records)
- FsiWorkItemPushListener observing WorkItemLifecycleEvent (scope-filtered to fsitrading)
- SLA deadline fields (claimDeadline, completionDeadline) on IncidentRecord + V107 migration
- 8 blocks-ui panels wired to trading desk dock-workbench (defaultOpen: false, temporary placement for C5b Ops Centre)

**Implemented (C5b Ops Centre Composition + Topic Unification):**
- Multi-page site with tabs() navigation -- Trading Desk + Ops Centre pages
- Ops Centre: 11 panels (1 DSL incident dashboard + 10 blocks-ui hostPanel)
- Trading Desk: ops panels moved to Ops Centre, audit + preferences panels added to bottom zone
- Push topic separators unified to colon-only (TopicRegistry trie requirement)
- Topic entity names unified to singular (`incident:*`, `work-item:*`)
- Incident summary endpoints for dashboard metrics
- 33 REST endpoints (see API section below)

**Not yet implemented:**
- C6: Full CBR pipeline, advanced quality dimensions (max drawdown, market timing, Kelly criterion)

### Trust Score Response

```json
{
