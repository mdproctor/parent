# casehub-platform — SPI Layer Rationale and Quarkus Integration

**Repo:** `casehubio/platform`
**Tier:** Foundation (first in build order, zero casehubio dependencies)
**Purpose:** Zero-dependency SPIs and types shared across all casehub modules.

This document answers the question developers will always ask: *"Why does casehub define its own identity, preferences, and path types when Quarkus already has those things?"* The short answer is that casehub-platform is not a parallel system — it is a thin, zero-dependency domain layer that Quarkus-specific code implements. The long answer is below.

---

## The Three-Layer Model

```
platform-api/   ← Tier 1: zero dependencies — pure Java interfaces and records
platform/       ← Tier 3: Quarkus @DefaultBean mocks, @ConfigProperty
testing/        ← companion: @Alternative @Priority(1) test fixtures (CDI API only)
config/         ← optional: scope-aware YAML + SmallRye Config preference provider
oidc/           ← optional: @RequestScoped CurrentPrincipal backed by SecurityIdentity + JWT
```

`platform-api/` must never import Quarkus, CDI, JPA, or any casehubio artifact. This constraint is what makes the SPIs useful to every module in the stack — including modules that have no Quarkus dependency of their own.

**Package structure in `platform-api/`:** `identity` (`CurrentPrincipal`, `GroupMembershipProvider`, `ActorType`, `ActorTypeResolver`), `preferences` (`PreferenceProvider`, `PreferenceKey`, `Preferences`, `SettingsScope`), `path` (`Path`), `memory` (`CaseMemoryStore`, `MemoryInput`, `Memory`, `MemoryQuery`, `EraseRequest`, `MemoryDomain`, `MemoryPermissions`). `ReactiveCaseMemoryStore` lives in `platform/`, not `platform-api/` — Mutiny is a Quarkus dep and would violate the zero-dep constraint.

`config/` and `oidc/` are optional — consumers add them as compile-scope dependencies to activate the capability. Each displaces its corresponding `@DefaultBean` mock automatically via CDI without exclusion config.

## Path

**Problem:** casehub needs a hierarchical, scope-labelling type — for case types
(`casehubio/devtown/pr-review`), preference scopes, and label paths. It must be
a domain record with strict validation, not a filesystem path.

**Why not `java.nio.file.Path`?** Filesystem semantics (`/`, `..`, absolute vs relative) do not apply. `java.nio.file.Path` also carries heavy I/O semantics and platform-specific behaviour. A dedicated record gives strict validation (no empty segments, no leading/trailing slashes) and domain methods (`isAncestorOf`, `parent`, `depth`).

**Quarkus integration:** `PathParserConfigurator` (@Startup) registers the separator from `casehub.platform.path.separator` via `Path.setDefaultParser()`. `Path.parse(String)` uses the configured parser; `Path.of(String...)` is always explicit and does no parsing.

**Harness convention:** Build scope paths as `Path.of("casehubio", "<app>", "<case-type>")` — org segment, app segment, case-type segment. This convention makes scope inheritance work correctly: `casehubio/devtown` inherits from `casehubio`, `casehubio/devtown/pr-review` inherits from both.

**JAX-RS integration:** `PathParamConverter` and `PathParamConverterProvider` are shipped in `platform/` (`io.casehub.platform.converter`). REST endpoints can declare `@PathParam` and `@QueryParam` of type `Path` directly — no manual string conversion needed.

---

## Preferences

**Problem:** case-type business rules that vary at runtime — *how many approvers does a PR review require?*, *is a security review mandatory for this commit?* These are not deployment-time settings; they change per case type and per installation without restarting the application.

**Why not SmallRye Config / `@ConfigMapping`?**

| | SmallRye Config | casehub `PreferenceProvider` |
|--|--|--|
| When resolved | Startup | Per-request, per scope |
| Can change without restart | No | Yes |
| Varies per case type | No | Yes |
| Scope hierarchy | No | `casehubio → devtown → pr-review` |
| Where stored | `application.properties`, env vars | File, DB, both |

SmallRye Config is for *deployment configuration* — database URLs, connection pool sizes, feature flags that are the same for every case. `PreferenceProvider` is for *business configuration* — rules that vary between case types and between installations. They solve different problems and belong together, not in competition.

**`MockPreferenceProvider` uses `@ConfigProperty` deliberately.** In dev/test with no database, SmallRye Config *is* the backend — you set preferences via `application.properties`. This is correct layering, not a workaround.

**`PreferenceKey<T>` carries a parser.** Each key definition includes a `Function<String, T> parser`:

```java
public static final PreferenceKey<HumanApprovalThreshold> KEY =
    new PreferenceKey<>("devtown", "humanApprovalThreshold",
        new HumanApprovalThreshold(500),            // null guard only — real defaults in YAML
        s -> new HumanApprovalThreshold(Integer.parseInt(s)));
```

The parser follows the Drools `OptionKey<T>` / `ClockTypeOption.get(String)` precedent: colocated with the key, no type registry, no reflection. `key.parse(raw)` is called by any string-source provider (mock, YAML reader). `key.defaultValue()` is a type-safe null guard — real business defaults live in the harness preferences YAML file, not in Java code.

**`Function` equality trap.** `PreferenceKey` is a record with a `Function` component. Records include all components in `equals()`/`hashCode()`, but `Function` instances only have identity equality. Two separately-created keys with the same namespace/name are NOT `equals()`. Always use `key.qualifiedName()` as map keys, never the `PreferenceKey` object.

**`config/` module design (recommended for next epic):** Implement as a SmallRye `ConfigSource` so the scope-aware YAML reader participates in the standard Quarkus config chain with proper ordinal/priority. This lets it be overridden by environment variables (higher ordinal) without custom code, and lets `@ConfigProperty` injection pick up preference values during tests without any mock. See `casehubio/platform#5`.

## Identity

### CurrentPrincipal

**Problem:** casehub modules need to know who is acting — `actorId` (a casehub-specific agent identity string like `"claude:analyst@v1"` or `"alice"`) and group membership. They must not depend on `quarkus-security` to express this.

**Why not inject `SecurityIdentity` directly?** `io.quarkus.security.identity.SecurityIdentity` lives in `quarkus-security`, which cannot be a dependency of `platform-api/` (Tier 1, zero deps). More importantly, `SecurityIdentity` represents an *authenticated HTTP request principal* — casehub actors include AI agents operating outside HTTP request context, system actors, and internal services. The semantics are different enough to warrant a dedicated SPI.

**How it integrates:** Real implementations are `@RequestScoped` and delegate to `SecurityIdentity`:

```java
@RequestScoped
public class SecurityCurrentPrincipal implements CurrentPrincipal {
    @Inject SecurityIdentity identity;
    @Override public String actorId() { return identity.getPrincipal().getName(); }
    @Override public Set<String> groups() { return identity.getRoles(); }
}
```

`@DefaultBean` yields to this automatically — no exclusion config needed.

**`MockCurrentPrincipal` is `@ApplicationScoped` by design.** No request context exists in dev/test mode. This is not a design flaw; it is the correct behaviour for a mock. `@ActivateRequestContext` is required before accessing `CurrentPrincipal` in reactive pipelines.

**`roles()` defaults to `groups()`.** This wires directly to `@RolesAllowed` without an interface change when RBAC is implemented. Override `roles()` in the real implementation if RBAC roles and group memberships need to diverge.

**Auth retrofit path:** `casehub-platform-oidc` ships the OIDC-backed `CurrentPrincipal`:

1. `OidcCurrentPrincipal` → `@RequestScoped`, reads `actorId`/`groups` from `SecurityIdentity`, reads `tenancyId` (required) and `crossTenantAdmin` (optional, defaults `false`) from fixed JWT claims. Anonymous identity returns sentinels without touching the JWT. Add `casehub-platform-oidc` as a compile dependency to activate — displaces the mock automatically.
2. `GroupMembershipProvider` real implementation (not yet shipped) → registers as `SecurityIdentityAugmentor` to populate `SecurityIdentity.getRoles()` from the casehub group store — this makes `@RolesAllowed` work with casehub group memberships, not just what came from the OIDC token.
3. Multi-tenant scope derivation via quarkiverse `TenantContext` is deferred (closed casehubio/platform#14 as won't-do-until-needed).

**`tenancyId()` and `isCrossTenantAdmin()` are abstract.** Every implementor must provide them — compile error if missing. Single-tenant deployments return `TenancyConstants.DEFAULT_TENANT_ID` (configurable via `casehub.tenancy.default-id`); real OIDC-backed implementations read from the JWT `tenancyId` claim. `TenancyConstants` is a utility class in `platform-api` exposing `DEFAULT_TENANT_ID` and `PLATFORM_TENANT_ID` as importable constants. See protocols `PP-20260520-439daf` (no conditional tenancy filtering) and `PP-20260520-e6a5f0` (bind tenancy in data access layer only).

**`isSystem()` checks `actorId == "system"`.** The `"anonymous"` sentinel marks unauthenticated; `"system"` marks the platform acting on its own behalf. These are casehub conventions, not Quarkus conventions.

**Missing: `actorType()`.** A TODO comment in `CurrentPrincipal` tracks this. `ActorType` (HUMAN / AGENT / SYSTEM) is currently in `casehub-ledger-api` and needs to migrate to `casehub-platform-api` before the method can be added. See `casehubio/ledger#88`. Prioritise this migration before the auth retrofit to avoid two-pass refactoring.

### GroupMembershipProvider

**Problem:** "Who is in the 'legal-reviewer' group?" — an inverse membership query. casehub needs this to route work items to eligible workers. Quarkus security answers the forward query ("what roles does this user have?") but not the inverse.

**Quarkus relationship:** Complementary, not duplicating. The real implementation should:

1. Implement `GroupMembershipProvider` (answers "who can do this task?")
2. Also register as `SecurityIdentityAugmentor` (populates `SecurityIdentity.getRoles()` so `@RolesAllowed` reflects casehub group memberships)

These are two different query directions over the same data source. Example:

```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class LdapGroupMembershipProvider
        implements GroupMembershipProvider, SecurityIdentityAugmentor {

    @Override
    public Set<String> membersOf(String groupName) {
        return ldapClient.membersOf(groupName);
    }

    @Override
    public Uni<SecurityIdentity> augment(SecurityIdentity identity,
                                         AuthenticationRequestContext context) {
        Set<String> groups = ldapClient.groupsOf(identity.getPrincipal().getName());
        return Uni.createFrom().item(() ->
            QuarkusSecurityIdentity.builder(identity).addRoles(groups).build()
        );
    }
}
```

See `platform-spi-contract.md` for the full pattern.

## CaseMemoryStore

**Problem:** every CaseHub case starts cold. Facts established in one case — about an entity, an agent's behaviour, a recurring pattern — are invisible to the next case unless explicitly passed as parameters. This produces repeated research, missed context, and weaker routing decisions across all consumer repos.

**Why a platform SPI, not a per-repo solution:** devtown, clinical, aml, and life all need semantic recall across cases. A per-repo memory implementation would duplicate the permission model, domain isolation logic, and backend adapter overhead in every consumer. `CaseMemoryStore` follows the same SPI placement logic as `PreferenceProvider` and `CurrentPrincipal` — shared concept, zero external dependency, displaces via CDI.

**SPI contract (`casehub-platform-api`):**
- `CaseMemoryStore` (blocking) — `store`, `storeAll` (bulk convenience default), `query`, `erase`, `eraseById`
- `MemoryInput`, `Memory`, `MemoryQuery`, `EraseRequest`, `MemoryDomain` — value types (zero deps)
- `MemoryPermissions` — static utility enforcing `CurrentPrincipal` + `GroupMembershipProvider` boundary; **enforced at the SPI layer**, never delegated to backends
- Domain isolation: `MemoryDomain` scopes facts — health, finance, household facts do not cross domain boundaries regardless of backend

**`platform/` contains:** `NoOpCaseMemoryStore @DefaultBean`, `ReactiveCaseMemoryStore` interface (Mutiny dep — cannot live in zero-dep `platform-api/`), `BlockingToReactiveBridge @DefaultBean`.

**`@DefaultBean` pattern — silent no-op (contrast with configurable mock):**

This is an explicit design choice, not a missing feature. The two patterns serve different purposes:

| Pattern | Used by | Behaviour | Rationale |
|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Configurable mock** | `PreferenceProvider`, `CurrentPrincipal` | Returns SmallRye Config values or fixed test values | System makes routing/auth decisions based on these values — wrong values produce wrong behaviour, so the mock must be explicit |
| **Silent no-op** | `CaseMemoryStore` | Returns empty results, accepts writes silently | System functions correctly without memory — just without recall; zero overhead is the valid production default when no adapter is installed |

`NoOpCaseMemoryStore @DefaultBean` in `platform/` is correct for the vast majority of deployments at startup. Adapters activate by classpath presence — no configuration needed.

**`eraseById` carve-out:** The SPI default for `eraseById` throws `UnsupportedOperationException` — a GDPR guard forcing adapters to implement erasure explicitly. `NoOpCaseMemoryStore` overrides this to a true no-op (nothing was stored, so erasure is vacuously complete). Adapter implementors must not rely on the SPI default for `eraseById` — override it unconditionally.

**Reactive bridge:**
`BlockingToReactiveBridge @DefaultBean` in `platform/` wraps any blocking `CaseMemoryStore` implementation as a `ReactiveCaseMemoryStore`. Native async adapters override with `@Alternative @Priority(N)` — the same CDI priority ladder used throughout the platform. See [`docs/protocols/universal/persistence-backend-cdi-priority.md`](protocols/universal/persistence-backend-cdi-priority.md).

**Adapter implementations (`casehub-memory` repo — `casehubio/memory`):**

| Adapter | Backend | Infrastructure | Best for |
|---------|---------|----------------|----------|
| Memori | SQL-native Postgres | Zero extra infra | Default — all deployments |
| Mem0 | Vector + BM25 | Docker + pgvector | Semantic retrieval |
| Graphiti | Temporal knowledge graph | Neo4j / FalkorDB | Regulated domains, temporal queries |

Add as compile dependency to activate. Displaces the no-op `@DefaultBean` automatically.

## Mock Implementation Pattern

The original three SPIs (`PreferenceProvider`, `CurrentPrincipal`, `GroupMembershipProvider`) get `@DefaultBean @ApplicationScoped` configurable mocks in `platform/`. `CaseMemoryStore` follows the same structural pattern but uses a silent no-op rather than a configurable mock — see the CaseMemoryStore section above for the rationale. The shared pattern for all four:

- `@DefaultBean` — yields to any `@ApplicationScoped` implementation; no exclusion config needed in consumers
- `@ApplicationScoped` (not `@RequestScoped`) — no request context in dev/test mode
- `@ConfigProperty` with `Optional<T>` — SmallRye Config throws `NoSuchElementException` for absent Map/List prefixes; `Optional` absorbs cleanly
- No hardcoded business values — real defaults live in harness YAML files; `key.defaultValue()` is a null guard

**`persistence-memory/` is not created for preferences.** The `persistence-memory/` module pattern (from `casehub-work`) is warranted only when in-memory has a production use case (e.g., ephemeral installs without a database). Preferences have a file-based production alternative (`config/` module), so in-memory is genuinely test-only and belongs in `testing/`. Not every `@Alternative` implementation needs its own persistence module.

---

## Testing Module

`casehub-platform-testing` provides `@Alternative @Priority(1)` test fixtures for identity SPIs:

- `FixedCurrentPrincipal` — programmatic actorId/groups/tenancyId/crossTenantAdmin control with `reset()` support
- `InMemoryGroupMembershipProvider` — in-memory group membership store

**No `InMemoryPreferenceProvider`.** Because `PreferenceKey<T>` carries a `parser`, `MockPreferenceProvider.get(key)` calls `key.parse(raw)` on config strings — typed values come from `application.properties` without a separate test fixture. This is why the testing module has identity fixtures but not preference fixtures.

Add as a test-scoped dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.casehub</groupId>
    <artifactId>casehub-platform-testing</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

**Do not define parallel path, scope, preference, or principal types.** `casehub-platform-api` owns these. If an existing type does not quite fit, extend it or open an issue — do not create a new one.

**Do not use `@ConfigMapping` for case-type business rules.** `@ConfigMapping` is for deployment configuration that is the same for every case. Per-case-type business rules are `PreferenceProvider` territory.

**Do not call `SecurityIdentity` from `platform-api/`.** Zero dependencies means zero Quarkus imports. `CurrentPrincipal` is the abstraction that keeps `platform-api/` clean.

**Do not make `CurrentPrincipal` `@ApplicationScoped` in a real deployment.** The mock is `@ApplicationScoped` for a reason (no request context in dev). Real implementations must be `@RequestScoped`.

**Do not inject `Principal` directly in Quarkus.** Quarkus's `Principal` injection is unreliable in tests and some filter-order contexts. Use `SecurityIdentity` or `CurrentPrincipal` — both are well-defined.

## Module Roadmap

| Module | Status | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `platform-api/` | ✅ shipped | Zero-dep SPIs: `Path`, `PreferenceProvider`, `CurrentPrincipal`, `GroupMembershipProvider`, `CaseMemoryStore` + value types |
| `platform/` | ✅ shipped | `@DefaultBean` mocks (configurable) and no-ops (silent); `BlockingToReactiveBridge @DefaultBean` for `ReactiveCaseMemoryStore` |
| `testing/` | ✅ shipped | `@Alternative @Priority(1)` identity fixtures |
| `config/` | ✅ shipped | Scope-aware YAML + SmallRye Config overrides — displaces mock when on classpath |
| `oidc/` | ✅ shipped | `@RequestScoped CurrentPrincipal` backed by `SecurityIdentity` + JWT — displaces mock when on classpath |
| `persistence-jpa/` | 🔜 #6 | JPA-backed scoped preference overrides |
| `persistence-mongodb/` | 🔜 #7 | MongoDB alternative for preferences |
| `preferences-editor/` | 🔜 #8 | Admin write path for preferences — REST API, separate from providers |

**Note:** `CaseMemoryStore` adapter implementations (Memori, Mem0, Graphiti) live in the separate `casehub-memory` repo (`casehubio/memory`), not in this repo. Add them as compile dependencies to activate.

`PreferenceProvider` is permanently read-only. The editor module writes directly to the backend; providers never own the write path.
